# Fraud-Detection-using-Autoencoders

I have used a neural network called an autoencoder to detect fraudulent credit/debit card transactions on a Kaggle dataset.
Dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data
The model will be presented using Keras with a TensorFlow backend using a Jupyter Notebook and generally applicable to a wide range of anomaly detection problems.
